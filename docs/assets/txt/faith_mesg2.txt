Hi Faith,
How has been your day? Hope Great?
Regarding yesterday's conversation, I would like you to completely ignore every thing.
I've been cleared.
Hope you didn't tell your mother anything?
It's not really an issue involving anyone or me thinking deeply. It's some kind of message from God to me.
I've gotten the message already.
So please, completely ignore every thing.
And let us assume nothing was said.
Thank you.
Have a great day ahead!
