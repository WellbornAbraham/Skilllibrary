COMPOSSED BY ABRAHAM WELLBORN KINGSLEY (Written 22nd August, 2021)

The Noble Universe
Citadel of knowledge
Educating the blind
For by knowledge darkness fades
The Noble Universe
The Noble Universe

Defender of the just
Pioneer of justice
Not for peace, not for war
But for justice to prevail
The Noble Universe
The Noble Universe

She will rise to the skies
She will show forth Her might
She will beat down all hills
Striking Balance here on Earth
The Noble Universe
The Noble Universe
